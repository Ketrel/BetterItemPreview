This is a simple addon that modifies the ctrl+click to preview an item.

By default:  
If you Ctrl + Click an item, it previews the item's applied transmog. 

New from this addon:  
If you Ctrl + Shift + Click an item, it previews the item's real appearence.

Additionally New from this addon:  
* Both functionalities are extended to inspected targets  
* Ctrl + Clicking on a Recipe will preview the crafted item


(MogIt, due to how it's coded, currently forces previewing the actual item.  This addon should take precedence over that behavior.)
