This is a simple addon that modifies the ctrl+click to preview an item.

If you Ctrl + Click an item, it previews as normal  
If you Ctrl + Shift + Click an item, it previews the real item, not the transmogged appearance

Additionally, this will resolve recipes if Ctrl+Clicked to allow you to preview the item they'd create.
