This is a simple addon that modifies the ctrl+click to preview an item.

If you Ctrl + Click an item, it previews as normal  
If you Ctrl + Shift + Click an item, it previews the real item, not the transmogged appearance

(MogIt, due to how it's coded, currently forces previewing the actual item.  This addon should take precedence over that behavior.)
